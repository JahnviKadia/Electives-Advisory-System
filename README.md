# Electives-Advisory-System

### I have created an electives advisory system in Prolog for MTech students. It needs to advise a student on what electives to take given the career they want to pursue and the pre-requisites that they have done. Advisory system here refers to a system that will take some inputs from the student and ask further questions to narrow down choices and then suggest to the student the appropriate electives. I have  written Prolog clauses and show explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.
